A simple system to keep track of pronouns — and genders — with JavaScript and TypeScript.

</div>

A simple and lightweight JavaScript library for managing and creating pronouns. **_Supports custom pronouns!_**
I got carried away one day and now this library also has genders.

Contibutions welcome.

The documentation is available [here](/?api).

## Installation

Install from NPM. Type definitions are included for you TypeScript people (including me), so there's no need to try and install `@types/pronouns.js` as a devDependency — it probably doesn't exist anyways.

```bash
$ npm i pronouns.js
```

## Support

There is no support for CJS modules (`require()`). Use ESM instead (`import ... from ...`). If it works for one version, that's a coincidence. There is no intended support for CommonJS modules, only the modular syntax introduced in ES6. See [MDN's JavaScript module guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).
